### How to get there from Athens
The only way to travel from Athens to Gytheio with public transportation is to use the [intercity bus line](https://ktel-lakonias.gr/υπεραστικα-δρομολογια-αθηνασ-πατρασ){:target="_blank"}.
The bus departs from the central Athens intercity bus station which is called [KTEL Kifisou](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dxYJdjkgMbuN8rZh6){:target="_blank"}.

The timetable on the website linked above is kinda confusing, so for your convinience you may refer to the table below.
